# JavaScript-Quizzer
A vanilla JavaScript quiz that determines whether answer are correct or not by actually evaluating the code - so any form of syntax is accepted as a correct answer, as long as the result is correct. No need to sandbox since code is run in the user's browser. This implementation should be fairly future-proof as well, although the questions themselves may be dated.

This was made more simple with ES2015 template literals (backticks), which allows me to pass in entire javascript functions without worrying about escaping characters, although it would certainly be possible without.

Future improvements:
Formatting to make it look halfway decent.
